# React Movie App

The **React Movie App** is a web application that allows users to search for movies, view a list of results, and display detailed information about each movie. This project demonstrates how to create React components, fetch data from an API, and implement search functionality.

## Features
- Search for movies using a search box.
- Display a list of movies based on user input.
- Click on a movie to view detailed information.
- Use axios to fetch data from a movie API.
- Utilize React hooks for state management.

## Approach
To build this React Movie App, the following approach is used:

1. **Project Structure**: Organize the project with separate components for search, movie list, and movie details.
   - The **Search Component** contains a search box to input queries.
   - The **Results Component** displays a list of movies based on search results.
   - The **Details Component** shows detailed information about a selected movie when clicked.

2. **API Integration**: Use axios to fetch movie data from an external API based on the user's search query.
   - Fetch the data using `axios.get()` with the appropriate query.
   - Use `useEffect` to trigger the API call when the search query changes.

3. **State Management**: Use React hooks to manage state and update the UI.
   - `useState` to store the search query and movie results.
   - `useEffect` to re-fetch movie data when the search query changes.

4. **Data Mapping**: Use the array `map()` function to render a list of movies.
   - Each item in the results component corresponds to a movie from the API response.
   - Clicking on a movie navigates to the details page to view more information.

## Getting Started
To run the React Movie App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   npm install
   ```

3. **Obtain API Key**: If an API key is required for the movie API, obtain it from the provider's website. Add it to your environment variables or configuration file, ensuring it is not publicly exposed.
   - Example: Create a `.env` file with your API key.
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_MOVIE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the App**: Start the development server to run the app locally.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
